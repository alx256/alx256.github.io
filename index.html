                <p style="font-size:200%;">
                    For my Extended Project Qualification, I produced a game for improving the visuomotor control of its
                    players.
                    Research has shown that action video games have been linked to an improvement in visuomotor skills
                    crucial for
                    daily activities such as driving. This game incorporates key attributes from games in which these
                    effects have been observed to positively impact the players. I wrote it in the Unity game engine
                    using C#
